- Only a spot up shooter?
- High level of ball pressure, active defender

Donovan Mitchell
- Pushes pace, dangerous in open court
- Great footwork on jumpers and attacking the basket
- Verticality on offensive glass
- Gambles too much on defense, specifically on closeouts - after getting beat, he’ll go for steals instead of trying to recover
- Does a good job attacking downhill on middle drives and finding shooters with crisp passes
- Great defensive intensity on Bridges

Max Strus
- Confident spot and on-the-move shooter, quick release
- Good defensive effort off the ball

Darius Garland
- Looked comfortable against BKN drop coverage in PnR, using floaters and a fadeaway, threw a lob
- Quick first step against Dinwiddie for layup/baby floater
- Quick first step in PnR, hesitation dribble

Evan Mobley
- Turnaround mini fadeaway
- Took Clax 1-on-1 from left wing faceup for righty floater going left on a middle drive, nice tough in midrange
- Good combination of strength and length but blocked a few times by Clax
- Pushing pace in transition with ball in his hands
- Awkward footwork against Royce O’Neale on PnR roll into switch

Caris LeVert
- Off the dribble jump shot threat, especially behind screens
- Willing CS shooter in transition as well

Georges Niang
- Not a great lateral defender, got blown by and led to an open 3
- Not much effort when defending off the ball
- Quick trigger in transition (missed twice)

Damian Jones
- Good position on a Cam Thomas rive but fouled him on the way down
- Stayed with Cam Thomas but didn’t elevate to contest/block the shot, allowed score on three straight possessions"
8/13/2024 15:16:30,10/25/2023,Regular Season,BKN,CLE,"Spencer Dinwiddie
- 1-2 on corner 3s
- Doesn’t look like he takes much pride in/ puts much effort into defending on or off the ball, screen navigation
- Just puts his hands straight up instead of getting low and physical
- Garland blew by him in isolation
- Doesn’t fight over screens, ball watches off the ball

Nic Claxton
- Lob threat
- Scored on twice in drop
- Contained Garland, later blocked Okoro
- Active on the offensive glass but isn’t as aggressive on putbacks when covered
- Doesn’t look for his own shot very much

Ben Simmons
- Shows good burst with the ball, pushes the pace
- Passive in the post/paint, missed one hook shot
- Looks for transition kick aheads, very willing passer
- After he gets beat, will swipe for a steal or give up instead of finishing the possession
- Can definitely put in more defensive effort on the ball - screen navigation, ball pressure
- Looks uncomfortable shooting the ball (righty putback)

Cam Johnson
- Can fight over screens better on defense
- Quick release on hand off 3s
- Threw the ball away as PnR ball handler
- Nice drive right, finishing with left hand

Mikal Bridges
- Pull up elbow jumper, solid from the midrange
- Looked a step slow on multiple defensive possessions against LeVert (let him go backdoor but tipped the pass, blown by on closeout

Dennis Smith Jr
- Didn’t fight over screen against Garland, poked ball loose on next possession
- Good job containing Mitchell
- Allowed middle drive by Garland to corner 3
- Limited ball security as PnR ball handler?

Cam Thomas
- Overhelped twice from strong side for corner 3
- Will look for his own shot even if off balanced
- 2 foot floater from baseline-to-middle drive
- Scored on/fouled by Damian Jones three straight possessions
- Tough shot taker and maker
- Attacks out of high PnRs with head of steam
- Jumper off of 2 foot plant going left
- High pull up volume
- 24 points in first half alone

Dorian Finney-Smith
- Quick release on 3PT shot (2 corner 3s)
- Good containment guarding Strus in PnR
- Baseline drives to his right
- Lost Strus off the ball

Day’Ron Sharpe
- Caught a lob from Dinwiddie
- Blocked Garland on a snake PnR
- Aggressive move at end of shot clock to hit contested baby floater
- Good verticality and not getting caught in the air on Strus drive
- Feels like he’s always in the right position in help defense"

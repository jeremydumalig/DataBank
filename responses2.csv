I don't know if there were particular reasons why it wasn't done this way, however this would have worked much better to watch the videos straight from google drive on our computers instead of through zoom. We could have still done it during advisory, we could have gotten access for that time period, watched the videos, and voted. The way we did it here, I feel like I missed a good chunk of the speech and definitely didn't really see what the person was doing. "

By restricting the time of voting and video viewings it can inhibit some students from making fully educated votes. It is unclear what the intent of the persons who made these decisions regarding the advisory-only voting time but it is very un-democratic and a form of voter suppression. Additionally, I found it troubling that Nueva chose to conduct the elections in this restrictive way as it goes against school values and it is unconstitutional in the U.S. In the future, I hope Nueva will make changes to the election process so as to demonstrate the intended significance of student council their efforts to be an inclusive community."
